        Letâ€™s build payment systems that make sense â€” for everyone.

        Through Logethica, I combine practical experience in payments and risk with a drive for ethical, accessible, and neurodivergent-friendly systems.
        Whether you're scaling platforms, improving compliance, or rethinking customer journeys â€” I help you do it with clarity and care.

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Digital Payments Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>I support platforms and businesses in making payments infrastructure more robust, reliable, and adaptable. From routing logic to PSP management and risk design, I help ensure systems are compliant, conversion-friendly, and built to scale.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Risk, Compliance & Fairness</h3>
      <p>I work with high-risk and regulated sectors to design risk frameworks and compliance flows that don't just tick boxes â€” they genuinely reduce harm. Neuroinclusive thinking helps uncover gaps that traditional risk models often miss.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Simplified Systems & Team Alignment</h3>
      <p>I help teams reduce overwhelm and operational noise by clarifying processes and aligning tech, product, and compliance goals. The goal: fewer meetings, clearer decisions, and systems people actually understand.</p>

  <h2>Why Neurodiversity?</h2>
  <p>Iâ€™ve developed a growing interest in how neurodivergent perspectives can reveal flaws in system design, risk logic, and user experience. Whether itâ€™s confusing interfaces, rigid workflows, or assumptions baked into fraud models â€” the consequences of exclusion can be significant.

  Thatâ€™s why I bring this lens into my work. Not to make things "easier," but to make them more thoughtful, ethical, and resilient for everyone â€” because inclusive systems are better systems.</p>
